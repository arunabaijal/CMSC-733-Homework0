## HW0: Alolhamora!
We begin this course by working our way through the core concepts of computer vision and deep learning. We will generate an edge detection algorithm that will significantly outperform well regarded Canny and Sobel edge detectors. In the second phase, we develop our own Neural Networks and implement a few well-known architectures. The aim is to understand how each network is created and can be manipulated.

### Running Phase 1:
In the file abaijal_hw0/Phase1/Code/Wrapper.py change hard coded paths to appropriate paths where the Data and Canny, Sobel Baseline exists.
There are 4 instances you'll need to change, on lines 75, 76, 103 and 105.
- Navigate to folder `abaijal_hw0/Phase1/Code/`
- Run the file Wrapper.py 

The program shall generate all the required images and filters.


### Running Phase 2:
For phase 2 of this homework, multiple neural network architectures were implemented. To run these networks, call the appropriate method in Train.py#TrainOperation
CIFAR10Model(ImgPH, ImageSize, MiniBatchSize, True) - for modified cnn implementation
ResNet(ImgPH, ImageSize, MiniBatchSize, True) - for ResNet implementation
Dense_net(ImgPH, ImageSize, MiniBatchSize, True) - for DenseNet implementation

Do the same for `Test.py` file.

In addition provide the approprate Base Path when running Train.py
- Navigate to folder `abaijal_hw0/Phase2/Code/`
```
python Train.py --BasePath=/path/to/CIFAR/Data
```

To run Test.py,

Change the ModelPath value on line 214 to the appropriate folder where checkpoints are saved.
